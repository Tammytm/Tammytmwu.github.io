"
step 1: The Odds Ratio is a measure of the strength of the association between an exposure and an event. For example: an association between being a woman (exposure) and a bowel cancer (event)

step 2: This measure of association is called “Odds Ratio” because it is exactly a relationship between the Odds!”

step 3: What do the Odds mean?

step 4(-_-): For example, the odds of bowel cancer in women are the ratio between the number of diseased women and the number of healthy women. The same applies to the odds of cancer in men. The relationship between two relationships is the Odds Ratio

step 5: The Odds Ratio takes values from zero to positive infinity. If it equals 1, it means that the exposure and the event are not associated, if it is less than 1, it means that the exposure prevents the event, and if it is bigger than 1, it means that the exposure is the cause of the event.
